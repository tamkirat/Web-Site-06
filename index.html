                  naked on the internet people have this
                  idea that they are I guess not
                  responsible for their virtual Behavior
                  like they do things online that they
                  would never do in person it would be
                  very bizarre right if you're a married
                  woman and you're around a bunch of young
                  guys not your husband and you strip down
                  half naked and you put your butt in the
                  air .

                  when you treat women well they become
                  better human beings, when you see that
                  broken woman that's horrible horrendous
                  cruel cheating there's a man, that's her
                  maybe her father it might be a partner
                  somebody's hurt and what happens when
                  men don't treat women well we create a
                  society of soulless women.
                  we create a bunch of women who are just
                  egotistical narcissistic, they are
                  hyper-independent they lose their
                  kindness but when you take.

                <p id="type-woman-text">
                  the reason being is because the really
                  emotionally connected woman who's super
                  loyal and super loving, she can't be with a man who's super
                  busy.
                   she can't do it she's too anxious,
                  she misses him too much she needs him.
                  home all the time she needs
                  predictability she needs stability, she
                  wants a home she wants you to help her
                  put the kids to bed at night whereas the
                  woman that's like. you can go on
                  business trips for a couple of months
                  you know I'll see you when I see
                  you ,she tends to be a bit more
                  emotionally detached so what happens is
                  that man ends up not having his
                  emotional needs met at work and
                  sometimes they can be missed at home as
                  well.
